JavaSscript Assignment 2
This assignment started out with good intentions:
To create a fun, interactive, game that was based on the music by the reggae music legend, Robert Nesta 'Bob' Marley. 
I had the good fortune of meeting him in his Kingston, Jamaica home in 1976 while there as an exchange student and thought this would be a fitting tribute.
**However, rather than enter the murky waters of music copyright laws, I chose to avoid those potential complications. 
As a result, we now have a relatively straightforward test that is based on basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR.  After all, would you know what to do if someone close to you suddenly became unresponsive and pulseless?  
Hopefully we can learn something about the complex, but wonderful you.  
Basic question were chosen to make this humerous rather than a structured pedegogical approach.  It is nonetheless a proof of concept.
The timer gave me the most challenge as I sought to understand how each line, that worked, until I broke it. LOL!
Great learning experiences come from challenges.
